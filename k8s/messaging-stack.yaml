# DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used
# 
# The messaging platform (RabbitMQ + Redis) is now deployed via Helm:
#   helm upgrade --install messaging-platform ./helm/messaging-platform \
#     -n missing-table-dev --values ./helm/messaging-platform/values-dev.yaml
#
# This standalone manifest has been replaced by the Helm chart which provides:
# - Better configuration management
# - Persistent storage with PVCs
# - StatefulSets instead of Deployments
# - Integrated secrets management
#
# Date deprecated: 2025-10-13
# Reason: Consolidated deployment using Helm for better management
