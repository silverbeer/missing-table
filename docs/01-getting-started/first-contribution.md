In this guide, you'll:
1. Find a good first issue
2. Set up your fork
3. Make a small change
4. Submit your first pull request
5. Get it merged! üéä

---

## Step 1: Find Your First Issue

### Looking for Good First Issues

Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/silverbeer/missing-table/issues) and filter by:
- Label: `good-first-issue`
- Status: Open

### Easy First Contributions

**Documentation** (Easiest!):
- Fix typos
- Improve clarity
- Add examples
- Update outdated info

**Code Comments**:
- Add docstrings to functions
- Explain complex logic
- Improve variable names

**Tests**:
- Add simple unit tests
- Improve test coverage
- Add test documentation

### Claim Your Issue

Once you find an issue you like:

1. Read the full description
2. Comment: "I'd like to work on this!"
3. Wait for assignment (usually quick!)
4. Get started!

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your Fork

### Fork the Repository

1. Go to [github.com/silverbeer/missing-table](https://github.com/silverbeer/missing-table)
2. Click the "Fork" button (top right)
3. This creates your own copy!

### Clone Your Fork

```bash
# Clone YOUR fork (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/missing-table.git
cd missing-table

# Add the original repo as "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/silverbeer/missing-table.git

# Verify
git remote -v
# You should see:
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/missing-table.git (your fork)
# upstream  https://github.com/silverbeer/missing-table.git (original)
```

---

## Step 3: Create a Branch

### Why Branches?

Branches keep your changes separate from the main code. Think of it like a draft that becomes final when merged.

### Create Your Branch

```bash
# Make sure you're on main
git checkout main

# Get latest changes
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch (use a descriptive name!)
git checkout -b fix/typo-in-readme  # For fixing typo
git checkout -b docs/improve-setup-guide  # For docs
git checkout -b feat/add-user-validation  # For feature

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
# * fix/typo-in-readme  (asterisk shows current branch)
#   main
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `feat/` - New features
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `test/` - Tests
- `refactor/` - Code improvements

---

## Step 4: Make Your Changes

### Example: Fix a Documentation Typo

Let's say you found a typo in `README.md`:

```bash
# 1. Open the file in your editor
code README.md  # VS Code
# or use any editor you like

# 2. Make the change
# Change "thier" to "their"

# 3. Save the file
```

### Test Your Changes

**For documentation**:
- Read it to make sure it makes sense
- Check markdown formatting

**For code**:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uv run pytest  # Run tests

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test  # Run tests
npm run lint  # Check code style
```

---

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes

### Stage Your Changes

```bash
# See what you changed
git status

# Add your changes
git add README.md  # Specific file
# or
git add .  # All changes (be careful!)
```

### Write a Good Commit Message

```bash
git commit -m "docs: fix typo in README installation section"
```

**Commit Message Format**:
```
<type>: <description>

Examples:
docs: fix typo in getting started guide
feat: add email validation to signup form
fix: resolve login button not responding
test: add unit tests for auth module
```

**Types**:
- `docs` - Documentation
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `test` - Tests
- `style` - Formatting
- `refactor` - Code improvement

---

## Step 6: Push to Your Fork

```bash
# Push your branch to YOUR fork
git push origin fix/typo-in-readme

# You'll see a URL in the output - keep it handy!
```

---

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request

### On GitHub

1. Go to YOUR fork on GitHub
2. You'll see a banner: "Compare & pull request" - Click it!
3. Or go to "Pull requests" ‚Üí "New pull request"

### Fill Out the PR Template

**Title**: Clear and descriptive
```
‚ùå "Fixed stuff"
‚úÖ "docs: fix typo in README installation section"
```

**Description**: Explain your changes
```markdown
## What

Fixed a typo in the installation section of README.md

## Why

"thier" should be "their" - improves readability

## How to Test

Read the README.md file and verify the typo is fixed

## Checklist

- [x] I have tested my changes
- [x] I have updated documentation
- [ ] I have added tests (N/A for documentation)
```

### Link the Issue

In the description, add:
```markdown
Closes #42  (replace 42 with your issue number)
```

This automatically closes the issue when your PR is merged!

### Submit!

Click "Create pull request" üöÄ

---

## Step 8: Respond to Feedback

### What Happens Next?

1. **Automated checks run** - Tests, linting, etc.
2. **Maintainers review** - Usually within 2-3 days
3. **You might get feedback** - Suggestions for improvements
4. **Make changes if needed** - Update your PR
5. **Get approved** - PR gets merged! üéâ

### Making Changes After Review

If maintainers request changes:

```bash
# Make the changes in your local branch
# (you should still be on your branch)

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "address review feedback"

# Push to your fork
git push origin fix/typo-in-readme

# Your PR automatically updates!
```

**Congratulations!** You're now an open-source contributor!

### Update Your Local Repo

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Get the latest changes (including your merged PR!)

# Push to your fork's main
git push origin main

# Delete your local branch (it's been merged)
git branch -d fix/typo-in-readme

# Delete remote branch (optional)
git push origin --delete fix/typo-in-readme
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Git Issues

**Merge conflicts?**
```bash
git pull upstream main
# Resolve conflicts in your editor
git add .
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

**Accidentally committed to main?**
```bash
# Create a new branch from main
git checkout -b fix/my-actual-branch

# Push it
git push origin fix/my-actual-branch

# Reset main
git checkout main
git reset --hard upstream/main
```

**Need to undo your last commit?**
```bash
git reset HEAD~1  # Keeps your changes
# or
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Deletes your changes (careful!)
```

### Still Stuck?

- Comment on your PR
- Ask in the issue
- Check [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
